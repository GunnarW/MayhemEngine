# MayhemEngine

### Ubuntu/Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libglm-dev libsdl2-dev
```

### Mac OSX
Installation of brew is suggested to easily install the libs. Ensure that the latest version of the Developer Tools is installed.
```bash
brew install glew glm sdl2
```

## Building and Running
To build this project there are two options. One is to use CMake which makes including new libraries easier, and handles new files added automatically to the src and include directory. CMake is a small new learning curve but makes things easier in the future.
The second option is to use the provided Makefile which is used as usual.

Running the make in a separate directory will allow easy cleanup of the build data, and an easy way to prevent unnecessary data to be added to the git repository.  

### Makefile Instructions
The makefile works as expected and must be updated with new files added in.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cp ../makefile .
make
./Tutorial
```
